# Sustainable Development Event 2022 

> Hello, welcome to my Microverse's Capstone 1 project, a Sustainable Development Event 2022 website. In this project, we are given with a [template design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) and we are tasked to make an (almost) identical copy of the design with modifications by adding our own content - which in my case is Sustainable Development Event 2022!

## Built With

- HTML
- SCSS
- CSS

## Getting Started

You can have a copy of this repo run on your local machine by just directly cloning it. However, you need to follow these simple steps to make sure you have the same linters set up.


### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- npm installed
- Linters: Lighthouse, Webhint, Stylelint, ESLint

### Setup

The Linters that we are using here are Lighthouse, Webhint, Stylelint, and ESLint. [This documentation here](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/html-css-js) shows you in great details how to set them up properly on you local machine.
